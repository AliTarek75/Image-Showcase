# Image Showcase Project

This is a website that I made back then when I was learning web development.
The main page shows images in a **grid pattern**, and clicking an image enlarges it.
Another way to view the images is in a **Card Layout**, where each image is wrapped in a card on top of each other. Cliking a card brings it to the front.
The card layout is available on another page at `/cards`.

## Run  
Open the page directly on **GitHub Pages** â€” no setup required.
